## Overview
### Description
ProfessorAssessor lets students find the right professors and courses for them by allowing students to periodically share experiences in the courses. In doing so, students can give each other a better idea of what to expect when taking a specific course with a specific professor.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** Utilizes push notifications for periodic reminders to post experiences and alerts for when a post is made under a course that a student is following.
- **Story:** Makes it easier for students to pick the right professor and course options available.
- **Market:** Students, particularly college students.
- **Habit:** Users may periodically use this app when making posts, and may frequently use it at the beginning of a new semester when determining trying to make their ideal schedule.
- **Scope:** A stripped-down version would still be interesting to build and there are a couple of ways to expand the scope of the app (ex. special options for professors using the app).
